        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>â…” cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup sherry</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a brown paper bag. Add chicken pieces, one at a time, to flour mixture; shake the bag to coat evenly. Place coated chicken on a tray.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 inch oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain oil from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Return chicken to the skillet and drizzle with sherry. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
